## Presentation
The presentation from the May 25th meeting is available in [html](https://github.com/cmcneal/automation_showcase_app/tree/master/example_automation_scripts/presentation/SQDG_May_25_2017_Automation_Showcase.html#/) (download the whole presentation folder and open the html file in your browser) and [PDF](https://github.com/cmcneal/automation_showcase_app/tree/master/example_automation_scripts/presentation/SQDG_May_25_2017_Automation_Showcase.pdf) formats.

## Sample application
The sample application can be used as a test target for automation tool/library demonstrations. All of the samples presented are against this application, and perform the same simple tests.

The application is just a simple sinatra/ruby app, no backend database or anything fancy. More can be added to the application if you would like to demo other features of a particular automation tool/library.
