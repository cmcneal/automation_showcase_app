# Automation tools/libraries/framework examples

## Presentation
The presentation from the May 25th meeting is available in [html](https://automation-showcase-app.herokuapp.com/presentation) and [PDF](https://automation-showcase-app.herokuapp.com/pdf) formats.

## Sample application
The sample application can be viewed [here](https://automation-showcase-app.herokuapp.com/).

The sample application can be used as a test target for automation tool/library demonstrations. All of the samples presented are against this application, and perform the same simple tests.

The application is just a simple sinatra/ruby app, no backend database or anything fancy. More can be added to the application if you would like to demo other features of a particular automation tool/library.
